# Functional Test Example in Slim 3

I created this project to demo some functional tests for a Slim project.

The skeleton has been created using the command
```bash
composer create-project slim/slim-skeleton php-slim=-project-functional-tests
```

## Install the Application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anoopmd/php-slim-project-functional-tests.git

cd php-slim-project-functional-tests

composer install
```

## Run the web server

```bash
composer start
```

You can view the app at `localhost:8080`

## Run the web server

```bash
composer test
```
